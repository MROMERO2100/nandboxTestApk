# Hi I'm Moises Romero and I am sharing the two file apk that I build and generete from nandbox.
I am a newbie using this tool, but I really want to learn and I am a self-taught person. I hope we can set up a meeting so you can see how my skills would add value to your company or project.

# nandboxTestApk
Two APK build in https://nandbox.com/ for testing

# This is the First App.
The idea here is to create a social network for a pet adoption center. Where you can see in the feeds information about the pets that you can adopt, also have a Donations section, where you can donate from the stories to donate to a specific pet or in general to the adoption center

# This is the Second App.
The idea here was to make an app where we could keep a diary of our pets, and be able to have the entire record from an App. This app didn't turn out well at all, I found it a little difficult to use nandbox. But this was the idea:
-Have a section where we could add our pets in case we have several.
-The main screen is like a social network, where you can go scrolling and see everything that has happened with your pets.
-Also if you have to give him medicine, have a section where you set an alarm so you can remember to give him his medicine on time.
-Schedule veterinary visits.
-And many other ideas I have.
